# 🧬 Proteus: Generative AI for Protein Design

Proteus is a modular framework for training and using diffusion-based generative models to design novel protein structures. It leverages deep learning, structural bioinformatics, and molecular simulations to produce valid 3D protein configurations (.pdb files).

---

## 📦 Features

- Diffusion-based generative model for protein backbone design
- Data featurization from raw `.pdb` files
- Simulation validation pipeline
- Modular configuration for experiments
- Visualization outputs using PyMOL/Blender
